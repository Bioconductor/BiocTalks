# Boston _R_ Meetup, April 2017

Title: Good software: simple, tidy, rich

Abstract: _R_ is a great platform to share our ideas with peers and
the broader community. _[Bioconductor][]_ is a successful and
well-respected project that allows academic and other researchers to
share highly specialized statistical and biological algorithms and
insights. Core values in _Bioconductor_ include reproducibility,
interoperability, and usability. We'll explore these ideas,
emphasizing the development best practices that you and I can adopt to
make great software. Bring your laptops for interactive enjoyment.

Biographical sketch: [Martin Morgan][] has been active in the _R_
community for more than 10 years. Originally trained as an
evolutionary geneticist, Martin has lead the _Bioconductor_
project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data since 2009. Martin is currently at the Roswell Park Cancer
Institute in Buffalo, New York.
